# Insect species predictor

## Summary
This project takes a dataset of insect images, uses them to train a model, then validates
and tests that model.

## Where the data is from
Images were collected from the field and documented in the file 'survey_data.xlsx'.

All data in this repository is pulled from these [course files](github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/archive/master.zip).

## Insect species surveyed
1. Rhytidoponera metallica:

4. Cataglyphis fortis

## Range of insect weights
Based on field data, weights of these insects fall within the following ranges (this is
just an excuse to use a table):

| Species | Min Weight | Max Weight |
|---------|------------|------------|
|DM       |36          |52          |
|DS       |140         |146         |
|OT       |29          |29          |
